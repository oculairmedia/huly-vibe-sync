## Codebase Context

**Project**: {{name}} (`{{identifier}}`)
**Path**: `{{projectPath}}`

This project's PM agent has a `codebase_ast` memory block with live structural data including:

- File counts and function counts per directory
- Key modules and their roles
- Quality signals (doc gaps, untested modules, complexity hotspots)
- Recent file changes

Ask the PM agent for architectural guidance before making significant changes.
