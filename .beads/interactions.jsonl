Database sync issues - stale/corrupt Beads databases\n2. Git state issues - dirty working trees, merge conflicts\n3. Missing git repos - some paths may not be valid repositories\n4. Permission issues with WAL files\n\n## Solution Needed\n\n1. Run cleanup script: bd sync --import-only on all projects\n2. Identify non-git repos that should skip Beads\n3. Add better error handling for failed syncs\n4. Add monitoring/alerting for sync failures\n5. Consider retry logic with exponential backoff\n\n## Impact\n\n- Beads ↔ Huly sync not working reliably\n- Issues created in Beads may not reach Huly\n- Issues created in Huly may not reach Beads\n- Git commits not being made for Beads changes\n\n---\nHuly Issue: HVSYN-5","created_at":"2025-12-23T04:00:25Z"},{"id":6,"issue_id":"huly-vibe-sync-1nt","author":"root","text":"Testing Beads to Huly sync - adding this comment from Beads CLI","created_at":"2025-12-23T04:02:09Z"}]}
