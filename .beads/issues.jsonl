Huly→Beads sync failure - Original issues never made it to Beads\n2. Beads deduplication failure - Beads received Huly issues but didn't recognize them\n3. ID/linking mismatch - Sync not maintaining proper cross-references\n4. Timing issue - Beads tasks created before Huly sync completed\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n- Issues created in Huly should appear in Beads via bd list\n- When Beads syncs to Huly, it should check for existing issues\n- No duplicate issues should be created\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\n1. Investigate Huly→Beads sync to ensure issues are imported correctly\n2. Add deduplication check before creating new Huly issues from Beads\n3. Compare issue titles/descriptions to find potential matches\n4.
