The deduplication at `temporal/activities/sync-services.ts` lines 212-222 only checks this stale in-memory list, NEVER checks the sync database.\n\nMeanwhile, `lib/beads/HulyToBeadsSync.js` has correct deduplication using `buildIssueLookups()` + DB checks, but the Temporal path bypasses it entirely.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n1. In `temporal/activities/sync-services.ts` `syncIssueToBeads()`: Add a sync DB check via `db.getIssue(issue.identifier)?.beads_issue_id` before creating\n2. In `temporal/workflows/project-sync.ts` Phase 3 loop: Refresh `beadsIssues` list after each batch, or accumulate created IDs for dedup\n3.

Agents querying the graph for 'Project Architecture' get outdated answers, leading to hallucinations during development tasks.\n\n## Solution\n\nIntegrate a Real-Time Code Watcher into VibeSync that:\n\n1. Watches file events (chokidar)\n2. Parses code using Tree-sitter (via CocoIndex patterns)\n3. Performs atomic upserts to Graphiti EntityNodes representing the code\n\n## Graphiti API Endpoints (Confirmed LIVE)\n\n- `POST /entity-node` - Create/upsert file or symbol entities\n- `PATCH /nodes/{uuid}/summary` - Update existing node summaries\n- `POST /api/tools/prune-missing` - Soft-delete removed files\n- `GET /api/utils/uuid` - Deterministic UUID generation\n- `GET /api/utils/edge-uuid` - Edge UUID generation\n- `POST /messages` - Add narrative context (commit messages)\n\n## Implementation Phases\n\n1. GraphitiClient adapter (lib/GraphitiClient.js)\n2. CodePerceptionWatcher service (lib/CodePerceptionWatcher.js)\n3. Configuration and integration\n4. Testing and validation\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- Graph reflects code changes within \u003c5 seconds of file save\n- Agent can answer questions about new code immediately\n- Zero race conditions during rapid editing\n\n---\n\nBeads Issue: huly-vibe-sync-642","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"noreply@anthropic.com","created_at":"2026-01-31T09:33:45.30922533-05:00","created_by":"Claude Code","updated_at":"2026-01-31T09:33:45.672478881-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-31T09:33:45.672478881-05:00","close_reason":"Closed","labels":["huly:HVSYN-891"]}

This caused FalkorDB OOM crash (4G → 7.2G memory) and degrades search quality.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nNo exclusion patterns in the file discovery or AST parsing pipeline. Every file in the project directory gets synced, including `node_modules/`, `vendor/`, `dist/`, etc.\n\n## Solution\n\n### 1. Add exclusion patterns to file discovery\n\nDefault excludes:\n\n```\nnode_modules/\nvendor/\nstatic/vendor/\n__pycache__/\n.git/\ndist/\nbuild/\n.next/\n.nuxt/\n*.min.js\n*.bundle.js\n*.map\n```\n\n### 2. Configurable via env var\n\n`AST_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS` — comma-separated glob patterns appended to defaults.\n\n### 3. Cleanup script\n\nProvide a script or entity UUID list for purging existing vendor nodes from FalkorDB.\n\n## Impact\n\n- ~50% reduction in Graphiti memory usage\n- Eliminates search noise from vendor code\n- Fixes OOM risk at current scale\n\n## Reported by\n\nGraphiti KG team (cross-project)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"noreply@anthropic.com","created_at":"2026-01-31T09:33:15.528366894-05:00","created_by":"Claude Code","updated_at":"2026-01-31T09:33:15.701216044-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-31T09:33:15.701216044-05:00","close_reason":"Closed","labels":["huly:HVSYN-917"]}

A dedicated expression block makes anti-slop enforcement explicit and enforceable.

The `identifier` column uses format `HVSYN-VIBE-{first8_of_vibe_uuid}` instead of `HVSYN-123`.\n\n**Root cause (two parts)**:\n1. **Identifier format**: The 174 records were bulk-created on Jan 31 2026 (all same timestamp: 1769869016091). The code that created them (likely now-deleted legacy `SyncOrchestrator` or an older version of it) used a composite key of `{projectId}-VIBE-{vibe_task_id_prefix}` instead of the Huly issue identifier.\n2. **huly_id never set**: The Temporal sync path (`project-sync.ts` Phases 1-3) NEVER writes to the sync DB. The only callers of `upsertIssue()` are in `lib/beads/` (HulyToBeadsSync, BeadsToHulySync, BeadsParentChildSync). The Phase 1 (Huly→Vibe) and Phase 2 (Vibe→Huly) paths in Temporal have no DB write step.\n\n**Impact**: `fetchVibeTasksForHulyIssues()` at line 368 in `orchestration-projects.ts` does `db.getIssue(hulyIdentifier)` using Huly-format identifiers like `HVSYN-123` — these lookups ALWAYS FAIL because the DB keys are `HVSYN-VIBE-{uuid}`.\n\n## Fix Plan\n\n1. **Short-term: Migration script** to backfill existing data:\n   - Parse `Huly Issue: HVSYN-XXX` from the `description` field \n   - Update `identifier` to `HVSYN-XXX` and populate `huly_id`\n   - Handle conflicts (merge duplicates if needed)\n\n2. **Long-term: Add DB writes to Temporal sync path**:\n   - Create `updateSyncDatabaseAfterVibeSync()` activity (can share with bd-jgl0)\n   - Call after Phase 1 `syncIssueToVibe()` succeeds — write `identifier=hulyIssue.identifier`, `huly_id=hulyIssue.id`, `vibe_task_id=result.id`\n   - Call after Phase 2 `syncTaskToHuly()` succeeds — write `vibe_status`, `vibe_modified_at`\n\n## Files to Change\n- NEW: Migration script to fix existing data\n- `temporal/activities/sync-database.ts` (shared with bd-jgl0)\n- `temporal/workflows/project-sync.ts` - add DB writes in Phase 1 and Phase 2\n- `temporal/activities/orchestration.ts` - export new activity","created_at":"2026-02-08T22:41:30Z"},{"id":270,"issue_id":"bd-avje","author":"Claude Code","text":"Implemented.\n\nDelivered:\n- Added migration utility: migrations/006_backfill_huly_identifiers.js\n- Added sync DB writeback activity module: temporal/activities/sync-database.ts\n- Wired persistence into Temporal project sync phases and bidirectional sync workflow\n- Added repository lookup helpers for beads and vibe IDs\n\nRun migration:\nnode migrations/006_backfill_huly_identifiers.js\n(optional) DB_PATH=/path/to/sync-state.db node migrations/006_backfill_huly_identifiers.js --no-fetch-huly-id\n\nVerification:\n- npm run temporal:build passes\n- npx vitest run tests/unit/AgentProvisioningActivities.test.ts passes","created_at":"2026-02-08T23:02:58Z"}]}

This activity should open the sync DB, call `db.upsertIssue()` with updated `beads_status` and `beads_modified_at`\n3. Call from `BidirectionalSyncWorkflow` in `temporal/workflows/bidirectional-sync.ts` after `syncBeadsToHuly()` succeeds\n4. Also add writeback after `syncIssueToBeads()` in project-sync Phase 3\n\n## Files to Change\n- NEW: `temporal/activities/sync-database.ts` (new activity for DB writes)\n-

Single File Operations\n\n- [ ] Create new file → Entity created in Graphiti\n- [ ] Modify file → Summary updated\n- [ ] Delete file → File marked invalid via prune-missing\n\n### 2. UUID Consistency\n\n- [ ] Verify client-side UUID matches server `/api/utils/uuid` endpoint\n- [ ] Same file always produces same UUID\n- [ ] Different group_id produces different UUID\n\n### 3. Debounce Behavior\n\n- [ ] Rapid saves (within 2s) only trigger one sync\n- [ ] Final state is synced correctly\n\n### 4. Burst Protection (git checkout)\n\n- [ ] Simulate 100+ file changes at once\n- [ ] Verify batching works (chunks of 50)\n- [ ] Single prune-missing call at end\n\n### 5. Hash Delta Check\n\n- [ ] Unchanged file (same content) skips API call\n- [ ] Changed content triggers update\n\n### 6.

When syncing a Huly issue with sub-issues:\n   - Create parent task in Vibe\n   - Create a \"virtual\" task attempt for the parent\n   - Create child tasks with `parent_task_attempt` pointing to that attempt\n2. Store parent-child mappings in sync database\n\n### Phase 2: Vibe→Huly Parent-Child Sync\n\n1. Detect Vibe tasks with `parent_task_attempt` set\n2. Create corresponding sub-issues in Huly\n3. Handle orphaned children (parent deleted)\n\n### Phase 3: Bidirectional Consistency\n\n1. Handle parent-child relationship changes\n2. Handle re-parenting (moving child to different parent)\n3. Handle parent deletion (what happens to children?)\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n- Vibe's model uses TaskAttempt as intermediary, Huly uses direct parent-child\n- May need to create \"synthetic\" task attempts in Vibe for Huly parents\n- Database schema may need `parent_huly_id` and `parent_vibe_id` columns\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Huly sub-issues appear as child tasks in Vibe\n- [ ] Vibe child tasks appear as sub-issues in Huly\n- [ ] Parent-child relationships survive round-trip sync\n- [ ] Deleting parent handles children appropriately\n- [ ] All existing tests pass\n- [ ] New tests cover parent-child sync scenarios","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"noreply@anthropic.com","created_at":"2026-01-31T09:33:56.459288121-05:00","created_by":"Claude Code","updated_at":"2026-01-31T09:33:56.679918872-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-31T09:33:56.679918872-05:00","close_reason":"Closed","labels":["huly:HVSYN-191"]}
