Agents querying the graph for 'Project Architecture' get outdated answers, leading to hallucinations during development tasks.\n\n## Solution\n\nIntegrate a Real-Time Code Watcher into VibeSync that:\n\n1. Watches file events (chokidar)\n2. Parses code using Tree-sitter (via CocoIndex patterns)\n3. Performs atomic upserts to Graphiti EntityNodes representing the code\n\n## Graphiti API Endpoints (Confirmed LIVE)\n\n- `POST /entity-node` - Create/upsert file or symbol entities\n- `PATCH /nodes/{uuid}/summary` - Update existing node summaries\n- `POST /api/tools/prune-missing` - Soft-delete removed files\n- `GET /api/utils/uuid` - Deterministic UUID generation\n- `GET /api/utils/edge-uuid` - Edge UUID generation\n- `POST /messages` - Add narrative context (commit messages)\n\n## Implementation Phases\n\n1. GraphitiClient adapter (lib/GraphitiClient.js)\n2. CodePerceptionWatcher service (lib/CodePerceptionWatcher.js)\n3. Configuration and integration\n4.

This caused FalkorDB OOM crash (4G → 7.2G memory) and degrades search quality.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nNo exclusion patterns in the file discovery or AST parsing pipeline. Every file in the project directory gets synced, including `node_modules/`, `vendor/`, `dist/`, etc.\n\n## Solution\n\n### 1. Add exclusion patterns to file discovery\n\nDefault excludes:\n\n```\nnode_modules/\nvendor/\nstatic/vendor/\n__pycache__/\n.git/\ndist/\nbuild/\n.next/\n.nuxt/\n*.min.js\n*.bundle.js\n*.map\n```\n\n### 2.

{"id":"bd-ydzp","title":"[Epic] Parent-Child Issue Relationship Sync","description":"Huly Issue: HVSYN-191\n\n## Overview\n\nImplement bidirectional sync of parent-child issue relationships between Huly and Vibe Kanban.\n\n## Current State\n\n### Huly\n\n- Issues can have sub-issues (parent-child relationships)\n- Sub-issues are linked via `attachedTo` field\n- Visible in issue details as \"Sub-issues\" section\n\n### Vibe Kanban\n\n- Tasks have `parent_task_attempt` field linking to a TaskAttempt\n- This creates hierarchy: Parent Task → TaskAttempt → Child Tasks\n- API endpoint: `GET /task-attempts/:id/children` returns `TaskRelationships`\n- Can set `parent_task_attempt` when creating/updating tasks\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### Phase 1: Huly→Vibe Parent-Child Sync\n\n1. When syncing a Huly issue with sub-issues:\n   - Create parent task in Vibe\n   - Create a \"virtual\" task attempt for the parent\n   - Create child tasks with `parent_task_attempt` pointing to that attempt\n2. Store parent-child mappings in sync database\n\n### Phase 2: Vibe→Huly Parent-Child Sync\n\n1. Detect Vibe tasks with `parent_task_attempt` set\n2. Create corresponding sub-issues in Huly\n3. Handle orphaned children (parent deleted)\n\n### Phase 3: Bidirectional Consistency\n\n1. Handle parent-child relationship changes\n2. Handle re-parenting (moving child to different parent)\n3. Handle parent deletion (what happens to children?)\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n- Vibe's model uses TaskAttempt as intermediary, Huly uses direct parent-child\n- May need to create \"synthetic\" task attempts in Vibe for Huly parents\n- Database schema may need `parent_huly_id` and `parent_vibe_id` columns\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Huly sub-issues appear as child tasks in Vibe\n- [ ] Vibe child tasks appear as sub-issues in Huly\n- [ ] Parent-child relationships survive round-trip sync\n- [ ] Deleting parent handles children appropriately\n- [ ] All existing tests pass\n- [ ] New tests cover parent-child sync scenarios","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"noreply@anthropic.com","created_at":"2026-01-31T09:33:56.459288121-05:00","created_by":"Claude Code","updated_at":"2026-01-31T09:33:56.679918872-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-31T09:33:56.679918872-05:00","close_reason":"Closed","labels":["huly:HVSYN-191"]}
