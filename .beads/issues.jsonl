Single File Operations\n- [ ] Create new file → Entity created in Graphiti\n- [ ] Modify file → Summary updated\n- [ ] Delete file → File marked invalid via prune-missing\n\n### 2. UUID Consistency\n- [ ] Verify client-side UUID matches server `/api/utils/uuid` endpoint\n- [ ] Same file always produces same UUID\n- [ ] Different group_id produces different UUID\n\n### 3. Debounce Behavior\n- [ ] Rapid saves (within 2s) only trigger one sync\n- [ ] Final state is synced correctly\n\n### 4. Burst Protection (git checkout)\n- [ ] Simulate 100+ file changes at once\n- [ ] Verify batching works (chunks of 50)\n- [ ] Single prune-missing call at end\n\n### 5. Hash Delta Check\n- [ ] Unchanged file (same content) skips API call\n- [ ] Changed content triggers update\n\n### 6. Error Handling\n- [ ] Graphiti API down → Graceful degradation\n- [ ] Retry on transient failures\n- [ ] No data loss on temporary failures\n\n## Dry Run Mode\nAdd `--dry-run` mode that:\n- Logs what WOULD be sent\n- Verifies UUIDs via util endpoint\n- Does not mutate Graphiti state\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] All test scenarios pass\n- [ ] Dry run mode works\n- [ ] Performance: \u003c5s from file save to graph update\n- [ ] No race conditions under stress test","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-24T01:23:25.044243928-05:00","created_by":"root","updated_at":"2026-01-24T01:50:37.397133825-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-24T01:50:37.397133825-05:00","close_reason":"CodePerceptionWatcher deployed and verified running.
