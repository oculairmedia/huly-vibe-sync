Original issues never made it to Beads, so Beads didn't know they existed\n2. **Beads deduplication failure** - Beads received Huly issues but didn't recognize them when creating new tasks\n3. **ID/linking mismatch** - Sync isn't maintaining proper cross-references between systems\n4. **Timing issue** - Beads tasks created before Huly sync completed\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n- Issues created in Huly should appear in Beads via huly-vibe-sync-3n2 [P1] [task] open -

Investigate Huly→Beads sync to ensure issues are being imported correctly\n2. Add deduplication check before creating new Huly issues from Beads\n3. Compare issue titles/descriptions to find potential matches\n4.

{"id":"huly-vibe-sync-6ed","title":"[BUG] Bidirectional sync creates duplicate issues - Huly issues not visible in Beads","description":"## Problem\n\nWhen syncing bidirectionally between Beads and Huly, duplicate issues are being created. This indicates that Huly→Beads sync is failing to import existing issues, causing Beads to create new entries for work that already exists in Huly.\n\n## Evidence (from GRAPH project)\n\n| Beads Created | Already Existed | Title | Status |\n|---------------|-----------------|-------|--------|\n| GRAPH-132 | GRAPH-101 | [P2] Update mutation paths to set updated_at | Done |\n| GRAPH-134 | GRAPH-104 | [P2] Update DeltaTracker to use timestamps | Done |\n| GRAPH-135 | GRAPH-102 | [P2] Add FalkorDB index on updated_at | Done |\n| GRAPH-136 | GRAPH-100 | [P2] Create migration script for existing nodes | Done |\n| GRAPH-131 | GRAPH-103 | [P2] Implement incremental fetch in visualizer | Done |\n| GRAPH-129 | GRAPH-106 | [P3] Implement Redis Stream consumer in visualizer | Done |\n| GRAPH-130 | GRAPH-105 | [P3] Create ChangeEventPublisher class | Done |\n| GRAPH-128 | GRAPH-107 | [P3] Integrate publisher into Graphiti mutation paths | Done |\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nPossible causes:\n1. Huly→Beads sync failure - Original issues never made it to Beads\n2. Beads deduplication failure - Beads received Huly issues but didn't recognize them\n3. ID/linking mismatch - Sync not maintaining proper cross-references\n4. Timing issue - Beads tasks created before Huly sync completed\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n- Issues created in Huly should appear in Beads via bd list\n- When Beads syncs to Huly, it should check for existing issues\n- No duplicate issues should be created\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\n1. Investigate Huly→Beads sync to ensure issues are imported correctly\n2. Add deduplication check before creating new Huly issues from Beads\n3. Compare issue titles/descriptions to find potential matches\n4. If match found (especially if Done), link instead of create new","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-26T13:20:59.422499172-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-26T21:48:11.072846293Z"}

Add better error handling for failed syncs\n4. Add monitoring/alerting for sync failures\n5. Consider retry logic with exponential backoff\n\n## Impact\n\n- Beads ↔ Huly sync not working reliably\n- Issues created in Beads may not reach Huly\n- Issues created in Huly may not reach Beads\n- Git commits not being made for Beads changes\n\n---\nHuly Issue: HVSYN-5","created_at":"2025-12-26T18:44:31Z"}]}
