# Agent Instructions

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd onboard` to get started.

## Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --status in_progress  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd sync               # Sync with git
```

## Beads Sync Flow (Hybrid System)

Beads uses a **hybrid sync** approach for reliability:

### Automatic Sync (Real-time)

- `bd create`, `bd update`, `bd close` write to SQLite DB
- File watcher detects DB changes automatically
- Syncs to Huly within ~30-60 seconds

### Git Persistence (`bd sync`)

- `bd sync` exports to JSONL and commits to git
- Required for cross-machine persistence
- Run before ending session to ensure changes are saved

### Best Practice

```bash
bd create "New task"   # Auto-syncs to Huly
bd close some-issue    # Auto-syncs to Huly
bd sync                # Git backup (recommended before session end)
```

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**

- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
